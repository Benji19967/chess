```{r results='hide'}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Load the data
```{r}
players <- read.csv(Sys.getenv("DATA_PLAYERS"))
```

## Get a glimpse of the data

This shows us the data types of each column and can be useful for knowing if we want
to turn a column from `chr` to a factor column.
```{r}
glimpse(players)
```

What are all possible values for title?
```{r}
unique(players$title)
```

## Convert character column to factor column

```{r}
players$title <- as.factor(players$title)
class(players$title)
```

Set levels in correct order.
```{r}
players$title <- factor((players$title), levels = c("GM", "IM", "FM", "CM", "WGM", "WIM", "WFM", "WCM", "FI", "NI", "DI"))
levels(players$title)
```

## Selecting columns

```{r}
players %>% select(title, yob, ends_with("der")) %>% names()
```
